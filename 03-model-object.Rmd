# The Model Object

* Saving the call is discouraged. If it must be saved, it should be checked for size. In cases where the function is invoked by `do.call("foo", bar)`, the data set may be embedded in the argument list `bar`. 

* Unless explicitly required by the model, the training set should not be embedded in the model object (exceptions being models such as _k_-nearest neighbors). 

<div id="minimal-back"></div>

* Retain the _minimally sufficient_ objects in the model object. [{note}](#minimal)

<div id="subclasses-back"></div>


* When providing a convenience interface that allows fitting more than one type of model, the resulting model objects should have different classes for each type of model. [{note}](#subclasses)
